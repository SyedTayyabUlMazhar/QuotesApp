Refreshing:
	- If the user presses refresh button.
	- If the user makes changes(e.g upvoting) on one fragment(e.g home) and goes to another fragment(e.g favorites)
	

Data initialization
	- Initialize data for all screens in init block.
	
How ?
	- When initializing
		+ loadUserData()
			- Collect from repo stateflow, filter defaults, and take 1.
		+ loadPlainQuotes()
			- fetch plainQuotes once in a try catch block
			- If there is an exception then set value to failure
			- else set value to sucess
		+ loadProcessedQuotes()
			- combine userData & plainQuote
				+ IF userdata OR plain quotes IS failure, then the result of combine is failure
				+ ELSE IF userdata OR plain quotes is default, then the result of combine is default
				+ ELSE(they both are SUCCESS), combine them together by setting booleans, the result of combination is SUCCESS.
			- collect : set processedQuotes.value to whatever is in collect.
		+ loadMyQuotes()
			- combine userData & processedQuotes
				+ IF userdata OR processedQuotes IS failure, then the result of combine is failure
				+ ELSE IF userdata OR processedQuotes is default, then the result of combine is default
				+ ELSE(they both are SUCCESS), combine them together by filtering, the result of combination is SUCCESS.
			- collect : set myQuotes.value to whatever is in collect.
		+ loadFavorites()
			- combine userData & processedQuotes
				+ IF userdata OR processedQuotes IS failure, then the result of combine is failure
				+ ELSE IF userdata OR processedQuotes is default, then the result of combine is default
				+ ELSE(they both are SUCCESS), combine them together by filtering, the result of combination is SUCCESS.
			- collect : set favoriteQuotes.value to whatever is in collect.
